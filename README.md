# ISRO Crater & Boulder Detection System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI/ML model to automatically detect craters and boulders from Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC) images. The system is designed to identify craters and boulders of various shapes and sizes, providing detailed information such as their selenographic positions and diameters.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Detection:** Identifies craters and boulders in OHRC images regardless of their shape, size, and illumination conditions.
- **Georeferencing:** Uses auxiliary information to accurately selenoreference OHRC images.
- **Data Preparation:** Includes scripts for preparing training and testing datasets.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes machine learning techniques for training the detection model.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Provides accuracy and relevance metrics for evaluating the model's performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms
- Image Processing Techniques
- Streamlit for Deployment
